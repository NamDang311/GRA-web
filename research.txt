Around the world it’s much the same, with fossil fuels being used for electricity, heating and powering vehicles.The world relies heavily on coal fired electricity generation because it’s often the cheapest form of generation. It’s also reliable and abundant.That’s what makes it difficult for renewable options, such as wind and solar, to compete in purely financial termRenewable energy sources make up the remaining 14 percent of Australia’s electricity mix.2 Hydropower, which began contributing to Australia’s generation in the 1950s, is the largest source of renewable electricity, contributing 60 percent of all renewable generation and 7 percent of total electricity. Wind, bioenergy and rooftop solar make up the other seven percent. Wind and solar power are known as intermittent energy sources, because they rely on natural sources and can’t be relied on for consistent baseload power. Wind and solar could contribute more to the electricity mix if their energy could be stored for times when the sun isn’t shining and wind isn’t blowing, but storage technologies are still a while off being a viable commercial solution.
